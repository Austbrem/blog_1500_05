            <p>A brand new desktop graphics card enters the market in china, it is the first GPU to support PCIe Gen5 and for a first gen card
            from a company besides Nvidia, AMD or Intel it does pretty decent, with synthetic tests showing preformance comparable to a mid range GPU 
            from a couple years ago. While it only has support for a couple games, in time this line of GPU could be competitive in the market.

            <p> Nvidia is lauching the 4070ti at $899 but the thing is, they were going to launch it as a 12gb 4080 but everyone was super mad at them because the card was not nearly as good as the 16gb model, so them selling it for $899 is a rip of.
                so they changed the name to the 4070ti and everyone hoped they would lower the price to fit the mid range graphics card but they didnt and people are mad.
