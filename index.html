            <p>A brand new desktop graphics card enters the market in china, it is the first GPU to support PCIe Gen5 and for a first gen card
            from a company besides Nvidia, AMD or Intel it does pretty decent, with synthetic tests showing preformance comparable to a mid range GPU 
            from a couple years ago. While it only has support for a couple games, in time this line of GPU could be competitive in the market.
